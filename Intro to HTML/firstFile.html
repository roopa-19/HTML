    <h1>b tag</h1>
    <p>The  <b>HTML element is used to draw the reader's
         attention to the element's contents,
         which are not otherwise granted special importance.</b>
          This was formerly known as the Boldface element,
           and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.
    </p>

    <h1>i tag</h1>
    <p>
        The <i> HTML element  represents a range of text
             that is set off from the normal text for some reason,
              such as idiomatic text, technical terms, 
              taxonomical designations, among others. </i>
              Historically, these have been presented
               using italicized type, which is the original 
               source of the naming of this element.
    </p>
    <h1>u tag unarticulated annotation(underline)</h1>
    <p>
        The <u> HTML element represents a span of inline text
             which should be rendered in a way that indicates 
             that it has a non-textual annotation.</u>
             This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, 
            but may be altered using CSS.
    </p>

    <h1>select tag</h1>

        The <select> HTML element </select> represents a
         control that provides a menu of options.
    </p>
    <h1>Button tag</h1>
    <p>
        The <button> HTML element </button>is an interactive element 
            activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger,
             voice command, or other assistive technology.

            such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

    <h1>hr tag</h1>
    <p>
        <hr>
        The HTML element represents a thematic break 
        between paragraph-level elements: for example,
         a change of scene in a story, 
        or a shift of topic within a section.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h1>br tag</h1>

        <br>where the division of lines is significant.
